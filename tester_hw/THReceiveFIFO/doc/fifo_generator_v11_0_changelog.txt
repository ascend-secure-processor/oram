2013.4:
 * Version 11.0 (Rev. 1)
 * Added support for Ultrascale devices
 * Common Clock Builtin FIFO is set as default implementation type only for UltraScale devices
 * Embedded Register option is always ON for Block RAM and Builtin FIFOs only for UltraScale devices
 * Reset is sampled with respect to wr_clk/clk and then synchronized before the use in FIFO Generator only for UltraScale devices

2013.3:
 * Version 11.0
 * AXI ID Tags (s_axi_wid and m_axi_wid) are now determined by AXI protocol type (AXI4, AXI3). When upgrading from previously released core, these signals will be removed when AXI_Type = AXI4_Full.
 * AXI Lock signals (s_axi_awlock, m_axi_awlock, s_axi_arlock and m_axi_arlock) are now determined by AXI Protocol type (AXI4, AXI3). When upgrading from previously released core, these signals width will reduce from 2-bits to 1-bit when AXI_Type=AXI4_Full
 * Removed restriction on packet size in AXI4 Stream FIFO mode. Now, the packet size can be up to FIFO depth
 * Enhanced support for IP Integrator
 * Reduced warnings in synthesis and simulation
 * Added support for Cadence IES and Synopsys VCS simulators
 * Improved GUI speed and responsiveness, no functional changes
 * Increased the maximum number of synchronization stages from 4 to 8. The minimum FIFO depth is limited to 32 when number of synchronization stages is > 4

2013.2:
 * Version 10.0 (Rev. 1)
 * Constraints processing order changed

2013.1:
 * Version 10.0
 * Native Vivado Release
 * There have been no functional or interface changes to this IP.  The version number has changed to support unique versioning in Vivado starting with 2013.1.
