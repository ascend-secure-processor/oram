2013.4:
 * Version 8.1
 * Kintex UltraScale Pre-Production support.
 * Full support for Synopsys VCS simulator.
 * Refactored the encrypted HDL to remove a level of design hierarchy and updated all core level XDC constraints where appropriate.  Most customer designs will not be creating XDC constraints which target logic within this core and so will be unaffected by this change.
 * Removed all generic parameters that passed through the readable HDL hierarchy of the core.  Generic parameters now only appear on the instantiation of the top level of the encrypted HDL portion of the core.
 * A new example design XDC file is provided to show customers how to override default XDC settings provided by the core itself for setup and hold timing adjustment of the selected physical interface.  This additional example XDC file is named <component_name>_user_phytiming.xdc
 * Added clock buffer information to the clocks defined in the out of context XDC file to support hierarchical design flows.
 * Added clock constraints for refclk, the IDELAYCTRL reference clock, to the out of context XDC for applicable permutations.

2013.3:
 * Version 8.0
 * Added Pre-Production support for 7-series Automotive and Defense-grade parts.
 * Added GUI option to include or exclude shareable logic resources in the core. Please refer to the Product Guide for information and port changes.
 * The MII now uses regional (BUFR) clock buffers instead of global (BUFG).
 * The GUI now defaults to the full duplex only option rather than full and half duplex support.
 * The IDELAYCTRL RDY signal has been included in the IDELAYCTRL RST generation logic.
 * Use inferred rather than instanced block RAM in the FIFO of the example design.
 * The transmit FIFO of the example design has been enhanced to drop very short undersized frames.  This protects against a potential address mis alignment condition.  Please refer to AR 56267.
 * Added support for the out of context flow.
 * Added support for Cadence IES simulator.
 * Added support for Synopsys VCS simulator (post synthesis or post implementation Verilog simulation flows only).
 * Reduced warnings in synthesis and simulation.
 * Shortened directory and file names of source files to help reduce overall path length.
 * When a Vivado project is targeted at either the KC705 of AC701 evaulation boards, a new Board GUI tab will appear to allow the user to connect the core to the on-board Ethernet PHY.
 * Updated the XDC constraints appropriately for any applicable version 8.0 change and to match the latest recommendations.
 * Enhanced support for IP Integrator by including additional bus I/F definitions and clock frequency metadata.
 * For IP Integrator, previous bus I/F names have been renamed for consistency.  Upgraded IP Integrator designs using this core will require reconnection of the Bus I/F's.

2013.2_AR57446:
 * Version 7.0 (Rev. 1)
 * For a VHDL project, the ipif_pkg has had its package name corrected to include the Component Name as a prefix. This will prevent package name conflicts between multiple cores in a single design.  Please refer to AR 57377.
 * For a Verilog project using the configuration_vector, fixed an HDL syntax error in the block level wrapper on a component instantiation and added associated missing XDC constraint syntax.  Please refer to AR 56625.
 * For MII, when using the AXI4-Lite management interface without Statistics, four unnecessary  lines of XDC syntax have been removed from a core constraint file.  These four lines previously caused critical warnings (which could be safely ignored).  Please refer to AR 57440.

2013.2:
 * Version 7.0
 * Supported Virtex-7 and Artix-7 parts moved to production status.
 * AXI-Lite address bus port width has been reduced so that only the lower address bits in use remain.
 * rx_mac_aclk and tx_mac_aclk clock outputs are now present for all core permutations.
 * Updated the XDC constraints to the latest recommendations.
 * Added a default case to the next state decoding in the AXI-Lite slave attachment block.
 * Enhanced example design and demonstration test bench to illustrate frame filtering.
 * Added support for IP Integrator.

2013.1:
 * Version 6.0
 * Supported Kintex-7 parts moved to production status.
 * speedis10100 and speedis100 outputs now present for all parameterizations.
 * tx_axis_mac_tuser is now defined as std_logic_vector for all VHDL parameterizations.
 * Added IP example design support for the Artix AC701 board.
